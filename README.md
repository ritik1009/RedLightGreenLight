This project is a game inspired by the concept of Red Light and the green Light game. In this game you need to first register and then select the difficulty then start the game. 

The game has a time limit that is 40sec under this time limit you need to click the green square only and if you click the red square the game will be overed. You have to click the green colored square min 10 times to win the game.

There is a Scoreboard feature also that lets you see how much faster you have completed the game.
